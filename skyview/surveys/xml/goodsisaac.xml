<Description>
    <![CDATA[
    As part of the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS), 
    near-infrared imaging observations of the Chandra Deep Field South (CDF-S) 
    were carried out in J, H, Ks bands, using the ISAAC instrument mounted at 
    the Antu Unit Telescope of the VLT at ESO's Cerro Paranal Observatory, Chile.
<p>
These data were obtained as part of the ESO Large Programme 168.A-0485 (PI: C. Cesarsky). 
Data covering four ISAAC fields in J and Ks bands were also drawn from the ESO programmes 64.O-0643, 66.A-0572 and 68.A-0544 (PI: E.Giallongo),
which were part of the previous data releases. 
<p>
This data release  covers 172.4, 159.6, and 173.1 arcmin2 of the GOODS/CDF-S 
region in J, H and Ks respectively. More than 50% of the images reach a 5-sigma depth 
for point sources of at least 25.2 mag (J), 24.7 mag (H and Ks) in the AB system ("median depth").
<p>
This final GOODS/ISAAC data release accumulates observational data which have 
been acquired in 12814 science integrations between October 1999 and January 2007 
totaling 1.3 Msec integration time.

    <![CDATA[
    As part of the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS), 
deep imaging in the Chandra Deep Field South (CDF-S) has been carried out, 
using the VIMOS instrument mounted at the Melipal Unit Telescope of 
the VLT at ESO's Cerro Paranal Observatory, Chile.
<p>
This data release contains the coadded images in U band from the ESO large programme 
168.A-0485 (P.I. C. Cesarsky) which have been obtained in 
service mode observations between August 2004 and fall 2006.
The 1-sigma depth for VIMOS U band in the area covered by the GOODS-ACS observations 
is ~30 AB (within an aperture of 1" radius, ranging from 29.5 and 30.2 AB). 
The PSF of the VIMOS U band mosaic is ~0.8" FWHM, but varies over the field.
<p> 
Also included in this data release is a coadded image in R band obtained from 
data retrieved from the ESO archive. Due to the different observing strategies 
adopted in the programmes the resulting coverage of the GOODS-ACS 
area is more complex than for the U band. 
The depth of the VIMOS R band mosaic over the ACS area ranges from ~28 AB to 29 AB 
(1-sigma, 1" aperture radius). 
The PSF of the VIMOS R band mosaic is ~0".7 FWHM and varies over the field.

   <![CDATA[
   The UKIDSS survey is the next generation infrared survey, a successor
   to 2MASS.  It will ultimately cover 7000 square degrees in the 
   northern sky at both high and low Galactic latitudes and goes about
   three magnitudes deeper than 2MASS in the coverage area.  Most data is
   taken in the J, H and K bands.  A Y band is available in some regions.
   <p>
   UKIDSS is comprised of several distinct surveys in different regions of the
   sky.  Of primary interest to <i>SkyView</i> users (since they have the largest
   sky coverage) are the Large Area Survey, the Galactic Plane Survey, and the
   Galactic Clusters Survey.  There are deep and ultadeep surveys which cover
   much smaller fractions of the sky.  The planned coverage for the UKIDSS
   surveys may be seen at the <a href='http://www.ukidss.org/surveys/surveys.html'>
   UKIDSS survey page</a>.  All UKIDSS data products are published by the Wide-Field
   Astronomy Unit (WFAU) at the University of Edinburgh through the
   <a href=http://surveys.roe.ac.uk/wsa>WFCAM Science Archive (WSA)</a> which includes
   more detailed coverage information for each data release.
   <p>
   
   
   <i>SkyView</i> currently uses the DR8 data release except for the Galactic 
   Plane Survey region where the DR7 is the latest public release.  Many thanks to
   the WSA team at WFAU for providing an interface to make all the latest
   data easily accessed.  Note that coverage is not uniform across the different bands so
   that at a given point there might be H and K band data, but nothing in the J band.
